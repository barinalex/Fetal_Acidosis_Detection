Abstractâ€” early  detection  of  fetal  acidosis  during  labor  is  a problem  approached  in  this  article.  One  possible  solution  is a supervised  machine  learning  classification  model  that  predictswhether  fetus  suffers  from  acidosis.  Several  models  were  de-scribed,  tuned  and  tested  for  the  mentioned  purpose.  As  a  sideeffect troubles with learning on an imbalanced dataset, that arecommon in medical diagnosis, were encountered and elaboratedon  the  way  to  the  main  goal.  As  a  result  of  experiments  itwas  found  that  cost-sensitive  learning  conducted  on  a  logisticregression  model  is  best  suited  for  the  purpose  of  fetal  acidosisdetection.  Codes  that  produced  the  results  published  in  thisarticle  are  a  part  of  submission.
