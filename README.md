  Abstractâ€” early detection of fetal acidosis during labor is a problem approached in this work. One possible solution is a supervised  machine learning  classification model that predicts whether fetus suffers from acidosis. Several models were described, tuned and tested for the mentioned purpose. As a side effect troubles with learning on an imbalanced dataset, that are common in medical diagnosis, were encountered and elaborated on the way to the main goal. As a result of  experiments it was found that cost-sensitive learning conducted on a logistic regression model is best suited for the purpose of fetal acidosis detection. Codes  that produced the results published in the article located in 'report/' could be found in 'scripts/'.
